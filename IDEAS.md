# Ideas

Some random thought fragments that might make their way into the project as some point

- Binary Hero: Kind of like Guitar Hero but instead of five lanes, it uses the two lanes on the BA63. "Notes" come from left to right across both rows on the BA63 and on the right there is some indicator showing the player where they need the note to be before they can hit the note successfully. Score will be how many notes you can hit before missing one (or two or three, doesn't matter really). The two rows will be independently controlled by the player's `0` and `1` keys.

- tinytax integration: Integrate the BA63 into tinyfax such that when a message comes through, it can be momentarily displayed on the BA63.

- Sky Pi integration: Integrate the BA63 with SkyPi in order to catch attention when rare events are taking place (aurora, new moon, etc.).
